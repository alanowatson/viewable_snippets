This is a viewable code snippet from Beast Music AI.  This repo is to give potential employers a place to see some recent code I've created.

This snipped is part of the update function for our database operation.  This code should allow the user to connect to our DB, and update an existing record.  

**Structure**

This DB script is modular, with separate files having a different operation for our API.  This is due to the structure of the Beast Music AI product.
I'd gladly talk about the architecture of the API, but that goes beyond the scope of this small repository.
